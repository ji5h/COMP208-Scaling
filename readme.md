# COMP208 - Scaling Project 

## Project Description

This repo contains files for the research, development and an academic poster outlining the project as a whole for a linear actuator stairclimber and a prototype of a tank track scaler that were developed for a group project for COMP208 - Cybernetics and Robotics.

This project required the completion of a contract to build a load bearing robot that should be able to climb two flights of stairs while carrying at least 2kg of weight such as a shopping basket. This load should be able to be placed at the bottom and easily taken off at the top.

A future iteration on this project will make use of PCBs to reduce the wiring and make a final version of the prototype of the tank track scaler as I found the linear actuator artefact was too overengineered and too unstable.

This project was made as a team so thanks to my team memembers Simon, Cas and Jason.
